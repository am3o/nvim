## The Law of the Config

### §1 - Ownership
This is my NeoVim config. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I must master it as I must master my craft.

### §2 - Bond
My config, without me, is just Lua. Without my config, I am just slower.
I must fight the bugs harder than the bugs fight me.
I must map keys faster than I can forget them.

### §3 - Dependency
My config and I know that what counts in code is not the lines we write,
nor the shortcuts we map, nor the plugins we load.
We know that it is the flow counts. We will flow.
